However, injury again played its part in Skippys campaign in 2022/23. Initially recovered from a nagging pubis injury that required surgery, the midfielder was then laid low by a foot problem that he picked up on our pre–season tour of Korea. That kept him out until early October, and it wasnt until Newcastle at home on 23 October that he made his first start since January. Nevertheless, Skippy grew back into the side and following injury to Rodrigo Bentancur in February, started 17 of our last 18 matches in all competitions, taking his tally to 31 appearances in 2022/23 and 82 in his Spurs career.

Until February, 2023, Rodri had made 26 appearances in all competitions, starting 24, and contributed six goals. That included late winners in comebacks against Bournemouth and Leeds (where he scored the equaliser and winner in a 4–3 classic) in October and November.

He had to wait until November to make his debut in a League Cup tie at Forest, before making his first appearance in the Premier League against Brentford on Boxing Day. That ended a sequence of 101 consecutive starts for Hugo Lloris, and Fraser was called on another 18 times in the second half of the season, playing more than Club captain Hugo. Fraser had an initial run of nine matches in all competitions – including a return to Champions League football against Milan – after Hugo suffered a knee injury in the 1–0 win against City in February. Hugo returned in April, but Fraser was back between the sticks after Hugo sustained a hip injury against Newcastle that ultimately ended his season.

The 2022/23 campaign was one of highs and lows for Hugo. In December, he led France to a second-successive World Cup Final, only to be denied history by becoming the first skipper to lift the World Cup trophy twice when Le Bleus were beaten by Argentina in a penalty shoot-out in a thrilling final in Qatar. He retired from international football after the tournament as France\'s most-capped player and captain with 145 caps.",
